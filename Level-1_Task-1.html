    <b><h3><p>Arijit Singh (born 25 April 1987) is an Indian playback singer and music composer. The recipient of several accolades including a National Film Award and seven Filmfare Awards, he has recorded songs in several Indian languages, predominantly Hindi and Bengali.</p></b></h3>
   
   <b><h3><p>Arijit sang the song 'All for 1' on Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's movie album 'High School Musical 2', which earned him his first exposure. In 2010, Arijit began working with 'Pritam Chakraborty.' He was cast in three movies by Pritam: Golmaal 3, Crook, and Action Replay. Arijit made his Bollywood debut in 2011 with Mithun's composition 'Phir Mohabbat Karne' from the film 'Murder 2', which was a major success. Arijit performed this song in 2009, but it was published in 2011.

     Arijit Singh sang the song "Dua" for Vishal Shekhar in the film "Shanghai" in 2012. Arijit performed the song 'Raabta from the film 'Agent Vinod' in Pritam's composition in 2012, and Pritam sang and published it in four distinct versions from Arijit due to its success. In the same year, Arijit also worked with Pritam in the films Players, Cocktail, and Barfi. This earned Arijit various prizes as well.</p></b></h3>


    <b><h3><p> Arijit's career was at its top in the year 2013. Arijit sang one of the most popular songs, 'Tum Hi Ho,' in Mithun's composition for the film 'Aashiqui 2' this year, and it became his biggest success. This love song was well-received, earning Arijit several honors and launching him to popularity as a playback singer. 'Jeet Ganguly' composed the music for this film, with whom Arijit has collaborated on other songs. Jeet was looking for a new voice for this film, and after hearing Arijit's song 'Dua' on YouTube, he decided to cast him in 'Aashiqui 2'. Arijit worked with Pritam in Karan Johar's film 'Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani' in 2013, singing practically all of the film's songs. Arijit was also named music producer for the film's song 'Balam Pichkari.' According to Arijit, this was a critical period in his career, as it aided him in his development as a musician. He has sung various songs in different films such as Phata Poster Nikla Hero, R. Rajkumar, Chennai Express, Boss, Jackpot, Goliyon Ki Rasleela 'Ram Leela,' and Mickey Virus this year.

     Arijit collaborated with prominent music directors like Sajid-Wajid and A.R Rahman in 2014. After that, he worked with music directors like Amit Trivedi, Sharib-Toshi, Vishal Bhardwaj, Sachin Jigar, Tony Kakkar, and Palash Muchhal. Every small and big filmmaker wanted Arijit to sing a song in their film at this time since everyone felt that one song might make their entire picture a smash.</p></b></h3>
